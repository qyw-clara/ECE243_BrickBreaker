# ECE243_BrickBreaker
ECE243 final project - brick breaker

The player smashes as much bricks as possible by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle which can be moved horizontally by the player. The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all 3 lives are lost, the game is over. The player wins when all bricks are smashed.
